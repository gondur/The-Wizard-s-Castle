ToDo list
=========

- Impatient vendors is not yet implemented

- Implement some way to track possessions of monsters/vendors,
  so if we trade/bribe gems to them, we can get them back later.

- Attribute-scramble function is still not optimum; 
  It still favours STR over DEX over INT.

- telePort needs to call react_to_room()
  Landing on a gargoyle should not be a painless experience !!
  04/17/14 - This has been implemented, but not yet tested.
